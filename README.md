# ECE-3400

Lab 1_A contains the .ino file for our Part 5. We had an LED connected to pin 3 (output), a photoresistor reading from pin A5, and a pushbutton connected to pin 4 (input)
The LED would output light at variable strength dependent on the value read from a photoresistor.
The LED would not light up if the push-button is not pressed.

Lab 1_B contains the .ino file for our Part 6. We had a servo that would rotate counter-clockwise when set between 1-90, rotate clockwise
between 90-180 and stop at 90.
